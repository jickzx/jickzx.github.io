Any feedback on this website will be very useful, as this is an unfinished project and may still be unfinished until everything looks polished, readable and has some animations.

This website portfolio was made as a fun project for me, to understand HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Currently, I want this portfolio to display my Computer Science projects, but as time goes on, I want to make it more crazy, like [landonorris.com ](https://landonorris.com/) and the company that made his website: [offbrand.](https://www.itsoffbrand.com/)
