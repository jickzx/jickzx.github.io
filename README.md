my portfolio website but i need to add more stuff!
Any feedback would be helpful - this may help me for future purposes!

This website portfolio was made as a fun project for me, to understand HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I do want to create a better, more enjoyable website portfolio but as a university student you can only do so much to attract the naked eye.
Why am I waffling? I don't even know myself 😭 but we'll get through it somehow
