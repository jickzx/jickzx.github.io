my portfolio website but i need to add more stuff!
Any feedback would be helpful - this may help me for future purposes!

This website portfolio was made as a fun project for me, to understand HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Currently, I want this portfolio to display my Computer Science projects, but as time goes on, I want to make it more crazy, like [landonorris.com ](https://landonorris.com/) and the company that made his website: [offbrand.](https://www.itsoffbrand.com/)
